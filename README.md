Java code to train document embeddings using cosine similarity, simply run the project in order to do so. All hyperparameters that need adjusting are in the top of the file NeuralNetwork.java, default hyperparameters are the same as in the paper.

Run ensemble.py in order to test the combination of document embeddings with NB-weighted bag of ngrams.

We highly encourage everyone to try and reproduce the experiments, and all thoughts and criticisms are greatly appreciated, thanks! :)
